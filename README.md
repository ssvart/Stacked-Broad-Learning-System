The core idea of this paper is the convergence of the stacking learning residual capability with the Broad Learning System (BLS), which further enhances the model's accuracy.
The current output as a feature for the next model to approximate the residual.
Stacked BLS with powerful fitting capabilities. However, due to its strong fitting ability, it is prone to fitting noise and other extraneous information during the iteration process. Therefore, the number of layers in the model should not be depth to avoid overfitting issues.
